### **Market Analysis & Price Validation**

This analysis compares the detailed, bottom-up "As-Specced" budget with a top-down market-rate estimate to validate the final bid price.

*   **Project Size:**
    *   **Total Conditioned Living Area:** 3,503 sq ft
    *   **Total Under-Roof Area:** 5,217 sq ft (includes garage and porches)

*   **Market Rate Research:**
    *   Current market data for new, high-quality custom home construction in the Austin/Georgetown area ranges from **$200 to $500 per conditioned square foot**. A median rate of **$300/sq ft** is a reasonable benchmark for this project's level of finish.

*   **Calculations:**
    *   **As-Specced Cost per sq ft (Conditioned):** $938,494 / 3,503 sq ft = **$267.91 / sq ft**
    *   **As-Specced Cost per sq ft (Under Roof):** $938,494 / 5,217 sq ft = **$179.90 / sq ft**
    *   **Market-Rate Estimated Price:** 3,503 sq ft * $300/sq ft = **$1,050,900**

### **Conclusion**

The **Calculated GC Bid Price of $938,494** is derived directly from a detailed analysis of the blueprints. The cost of **$267.91 per conditioned square foot** falls competitively within the current market range for this location and quality level. The bid is considered fair, well-documented, and reflects the specific requirements of the Hernandez Residence project. The slightly lower-than-market-average cost per square foot is attributed to a single-story design on a slab foundation, which is typically more cost-effective to construct than a multi-story home with a more complex foundation.
