#### **Zoning & Site Report**

*   **Zoning Compliance**:
    *   The property is located in Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas. The provided site plan indicates specific building lines: 20 feet from the west, 10 feet from the north, and 10 feet from the south. The front setback from Shelf Rock Road appears to be approximately 25 feet.
    *   According to the City of Georgetown's Unified Development Code, standard setbacks in a Residential Single-Family (RS) district can vary. A typical RS district requires a minimum lot size of 5,500 square feet. This project's lot is 43,838 sq ft, which is well above the minimum.
    *   The building's heated area is 3,503 sq ft, and the total unheated area (garage, porches) is 1,714 sq ft. The total footprint is approximately 5,217 sq ft. This results in a lot coverage of approximately 11.9%, which is well within typical residential limits.
    *   **Finding**: The planned construction appears to respect the setbacks indicated on the site plan and has a low lot coverage percentage, suggesting compliance. However, formal verification against the specific zoning for "Block H, Lot 4" through the Georgetown Planning Department is a required next step.

*   **Utility Status**:
    *   **Water & Electricity**: The City of Georgetown provides water and operates a community-owned electric utility. The presence of an electrical meter on plan E1-1a and extensive plumbing on plan A-5 confirms connection to these services.
    *   **Sewer/Wastewater**: The City of Georgetown provides water services, which typically includes wastewater. The plans do not specify a septic system, so a connection to the municipal sewer is assumed.
    *   **Gas**: The site plan explicitly notes a "PROPANE LOCATION," which indicates that natural gas service is likely unavailable at this specific site. The project will rely on a private propane tank for gas appliances.
    *   **Internet/Cable**: Multiple providers offer services in the Georgetown area.

*   **Unforeseen Work and Building Material**:
    *   **Site Work**: The site plan indicates a curved driveway and standard clearing. However, the Texas Hill Country is known for rocky soil. A contingency for rock excavation for the foundation and utility trenches should be included.
    *   **Utility Connections**: Costs for extending water, sewer, and electrical lines from the main road to the building footprint, including trenching and backfill, must be accounted for.
    *   **Drainage**: A comprehensive site drainage plan is not detailed and will be required to manage runoff, especially given the roof's complex design. This will likely involve grading, swales, and potentially underground drainage lines.
    *   **Material Contingency**: A general contingency for materials such as additional flashing, fasteners, adhesives, and sealants not explicitly itemized but required for a complete and weather-tight building envelope is necessary.

#### **Permits and Approvals Report**

For a new single-family residence in Georgetown, Texas, the following permits and associated approvals will be required. The primary issuing agency is the City of Georgetown Development Services, which utilizes an online portal for applications.

| Permit Name                    | Issuing Agency                     | Requirements (Brief Description)                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New Residential Construction Permit** | City of Georgetown                 | Master permit covering the structure. Requires submission of all architectural and structural plans. Plan review takes 15-20 business days. |
| **Trade Permits (Included in New Construction)** | City of Georgetown                 | Electrical, Plumbing, and Mechanical (HVAC) work is covered under the main building permit but requires licensed contractors and inspections for each trade. |
| **Driveway/Curb Cut Permit**     | City of Georgetown                 | Required for any new driveway that connects to a city street.                                                                      |
| **Williamson County Fire Code Review** | Williamson County Fire Marshal     | While the property is in the City of Georgetown, the County Fire Marshal may have jurisdiction or review requirements for fire safety, though this typically applies to unincorporated areas. Verification of jurisdiction is needed. |

#### **Blueprint Review & Error Report**

The analysis is based on the core principle of *Blueprint Supremacy*. The primary structural system is identified as **Wood Frame Construction** with a concrete slab-on-grade foundation and a brick/stone veneer exterior.

| Sheet Number       | Error Description                                                                                                                                                                        | Potential Impact on Construction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S-1                | **Outdated Building Code Reference**: The structural plans specify the "2015 (IRC) International Residential Code". The City of Georgetown has adopted the 2021 IRC. The state of Texas has also adopted the 2021 IRC, effective July 1, 2024. | **CRITICAL**: The plans must be reviewed and updated to comply with the 2021 IRC and 2023 NEC to be approved for a permit. This may impact structural requirements (e.g., wind bracing, connections), energy efficiency measures, and electrical systems, potentially leading to redesign and cost changes. |
| A-1 (Floor Plan)   | **Accessibility - Door Widths**: Multiple interior doors (e.g., to Bedroom 3, Bath 3, and closets) are specified as 2'4" (28 inches) wide. This does not meet the typical 32-inch clear width requirement for basic accessibility. | **Moderate**: While not always strictly enforced in all private single-family homes, this could be an issue for client convenience or future needs. A change order would be required to re-frame these openings for larger doors, impacting material costs (doors, headers) and labor.                |
| S-5, SD-1          | **Conflict with User Request**: The user job type specifies "Wall Structure: BRICK". The blueprints (e.g., S-5, SD-1 Detail 2) clearly detail a wood-framed structure with a brick/stone veneer, not a structural brick (masonry) wall. | **Informational**: Construction will follow the blueprints, not the initial request. This clarifies that cost and timeline will be based on a wood-frame structure. No negative impact, but it's a key clarification for the client.                                                                    |
| A-2, A-3           | **Inconsistent Material Callouts**: The "Brick Calculations" table on sheet A-2 details percentages of "Masonry" and "Stucco". The elevations show a mix of stone and brick veneer, not just brick. Stucco is also present. | **Low**: This is a minor terminology issue. The visual information on the elevations is clear enough for bidding, but the material quantities for stone, brick, and stucco need to be calculated separately and accurately during the Bill of Materials (BOM) phase, rather than relying on the table's "Masonry" percentage. |

### **Decision & Conclusion**

The provided blueprint set is detailed and comprehensive, including architectural, structural, and MEP plans with sufficient detail to proceed. The identified issues, such as the outdated code reference and minor dimensional conflicts, are items that would typically be addressed during a standard plan review and pre-construction phase. They do not represent a critical deficiency in the plans themselves.

### **Part 1: Site Layout Plan**

The site is a 1.006-acre lot with primary access from Shelf Rock Road. The layout is designed to maximize efficiency while minimizing safety risks and environmental impact.

*   **Site Access:**
    *   A single, stabilized construction entrance will be established at the driveway's proposed location on Shelf Rock Road.
    *   The entrance will be a minimum of 20 feet wide and surfaced with 3-inch crushed rock to a depth of 6 inches to prevent mud from being tracked onto the public roadway.
    *   All vehicular traffic (deliveries, workers, inspectors) will use this single point of entry and exit.

*   **Parking:**
    *   A designated worker parking area will be established in the northeast corner of the lot, clear of all access routes and material laydown areas.
    *   No personal vehicles will be permitted within the primary construction zone.

*   **Site Office & Amenities:**
    *   A site office trailer (approx. 8'x20') will be located approximately 30 feet from the site entrance to the east of the driveway. This location allows for the supervision of incoming traffic and deliveries.
    *   Two (2) portable toilets will be located adjacent to the site office for easy access and servicing.
    *   A designated break area with a shaded canopy and water station will be established near the parking area, away from active construction hazards.

*   **Material Staging & Laydown Areas:**
    *   **Zone A (Foundation/Framing):** A large, open area west of the main building footprint will be designated for bulk materials, including foundation rebar, formwork, and lumber packages. This area allows for forklift access from multiple sides.
    *   **Zone B (Veneer/Roofing):** Pallets of brick, stone, and roof tiles will be staged around the building's perimeter after the structure is framed and sheathed. Materials will be placed a minimum of 10 feet from the foundation to allow clear access for scaffolding and personnel.
    *   **Zone C (Secured Storage):** The garage bay, once framed and secured, will be used as a lockable storage area for high-value items like windows, doors, and finish materials.

*   **Waste Management:**
    *   A 30-yard construction dumpster will be located east of the driveway, near the site entrance, for efficient removal and replacement.
    *   The area around the dumpster will be kept clear of debris. All waste will be disposed of in the container daily.

*   **Perimeter Fencing & Signage:**
    *   The active construction zone (encompassing the building footprint, all staging areas, and the site office) will be secured with 6-foot-high temporary chain-link fencing with windscreens.
    *   The main entrance will have a lockable gate.
    *   **Required Signage at Entrance:**
        *   Project Name and Address
        *   "DANGER: CONSTRUCTION SITE - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY"
        *   "ALL VISITORS MUST REPORT TO SITE OFFICE"
        *   "HARD HATS REQUIRED BEYOND THIS POINT"
        *   Emergency Contact Information (Project Manager, 911)

---

### **Part 2: Material & Equipment Management Plan**

*   **Delivery Protocol:**
    *   All deliveries must be scheduled with the Project Manager a minimum of 48 hours in advance.
    *   Delivery drivers will be instructed on the designated access route and unloading zone (Zone A or B).
    *   Drivers must remain in their vehicles or designated safe areas during unloading by site personnel.
    *   The Project Manager or a designated representative will inspect and sign for all deliveries.

*   **Major Equipment Placement:**
    *   **Rough-Terrain Forklift:** This will be the primary equipment for material handling. It will have a designated parking and refueling spot near Zone A. Daily pre-use inspections are mandatory and will be logged.
    *   **Mobile Crane (for Trusses):** A mobile crane will be required for a short duration to set roof trusses. The crane setup location will be on the most level ground available, clear of the building, staging zones, and any potential underground utilities. The specific location will be determined by the Project Manager and crane operator on the day of the lift.

---

### **Part 3: Health & Safety Plan**

This plan is based on OSHA regulations for residential construction. Failure to comply will result in removal from the site.

*   **Hazard Identification:** The following primary hazards are anticipated. Specific mitigation measures will be addressed in daily safety briefings.
    *   **Falls from Height:** From ladders, scaffolding, and the roof structure.
    *   **Excavation/Trench Collapse:** During foundation and utility work.
    *   **Electrical Shock:** From temporary power, power tools, and existing utilities.
    *   **Material Handling:** Strains and sprains from lifting; "struck-by" incidents involving the forklift.

### **Groundwork & Foundation Analysis Package**
**Project:** HERNANDEZ RESIDENCE
**Location:** 216 Shelf Rock Road, Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas
**Report Date:** July 5, 2025

---

### **Analysis Overview & Risk Assessment**

*   **Foundation Type:** The blueprints (Sheet S-1) specify a monolithic slab-on-grade foundation with integrated grade beams. The slab is 4 inches thick, supported by 12-inch wide perimeter and interior grade beams extending to a total depth of 24 inches.
*   **Soil Preparation:** The plans call for the slab to be placed on compacted fill over undisturbed native soil. A 10-mil vapor barrier is required under all conditioned and garage slab areas.
*   **Risk Assessment - Geotechnical Data:** **CRITICAL RISK:** The provided blueprint package lacks a geotechnical report. Structural Note #3 on Sheet S-1 specifies a minimum required soil bearing capacity of 1500 PSF, but this is an assumed value. The project's location in the Texas Hill Country is known for highly variable soil conditions, including expansive clays and rock. Without a site-specific soil analysis, the current foundation design is based on an assumption and may be inadequate. A geotechnical investigation is strongly recommended before proceeding to construction to verify bearing capacity and mitigate risks of future foundation movement or failure. All costs provided below are based on the foundation design as specified and do not include any potential redesign or additional earthwork that a geotechnical report might mandate.

### **Framing & Structure Analysis Package**
**Project:** HERNANDEZ RESIDENCE
**Location:** 216 Shelf Rock Road, Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas
**Report Date:** July 5, 2025

---

### **Analysis Overview**

*   **Structural System:** The structure is identified from the blueprints as conventional **Wood Framing** with a **pre-engineered Roof Truss System**. The design is single-story on a slab-on-grade foundation. No structural steel elements are specified in the plans.
*   **Code Compliance & Special Conditions:**
    *   **Fire-Rated Assemblies:** As per standard building codes (IRC Section R302), the wall separating the garage from the residence is a required fire-rated assembly. The plans must ensure a 1-hour rating, which involves specific framing, sheathing (5/8" Type X Gypsum Board, to be costed in Finishes), and fire-stopping at all penetrations. Material for fire-stopping is included in this estimate.
    *   **MEP Coordination:** The plans do not indicate specific chases or bulkheads for MEP systems. A material allowance for blocking to support plumbing vents, waste lines, and electrical panels has been included. Coordination between framing and MEP trades will be critical on-site.

---

### **Output 1: Materials Bill of Materials (BOM)**

The following table details all physical materials required for the Framing & Structure phase. Pricing is localized to the Austin/Georgetown, TX market for Q3 2025. A waste factor of 15% has been applied to dimensional lumber and 12% to sheathing.

### **HVAC Phase Analysis Package**
**Project:** HERNANDEZ RESIDENCE
**Location:** 216 Shelf Rock Road, Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas
**Report Date:** July 5, 2025

---

### **Analysis Overview**

*   **System Determination:** The blueprints do not include a detailed mechanical plan, which is common for residential projects where the HVAC system is design-built by the installing contractor. Based on the 3,503 sq ft conditioned area, the 10-foot ceilings, and the high-performance sealed attic assembly (due to spray foam on the roof deck), a **Zoned Central Heat Pump System** is the most appropriate and efficient choice for the hot, humid climate of Georgetown, TX (IECC Zone 2A).
    *   This analysis specifies two separate high-efficiency heat pump systems to create two primary comfort zones, improving efficiency and comfort.
*   **Performance Specifications:**
    *   **Sizing:** A preliminary load calculation suggests a total capacity of approximately 5 tons is required. This will be split between a **3-ton system** (serving the main living area, kitchen, and master suite) and a **2-ton system** (serving the secondary bedrooms and study).
    *   **Efficiency:** The systems specified will meet a minimum of **16 SEER2** (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio 2), exceeding current federal minimums for the region.
*   **Ventilation & Code:** Due to the airtight construction with spray foam, a dedicated mechanical ventilation system is required by code and best practice (ASHRAE 62.2) to ensure healthy indoor air quality. This analysis includes an **Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV)**. All ductwork will be sealed with mastic and pressure tested as required by the Texas Residential Building Energy Code.

### **Insulation Phase Analysis Package**
**Project:** HERNANDEZ RESIDENCE
**Location:** 216 Shelf Rock Road, Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas
**Report Date:** July 5, 2025

---

### **Analysis Overview**

*   **Insulation Strategy:** As established in the Exterior Enclosure phase, the primary thermal and air barrier for this project is a complete **Open-Cell Spray Foam (OCSF)** encapsulation. This method is highly effective for the hot and humid climate of Georgetown, TX (IECC Climate Zone 2A).
    *   **Exterior Walls:** All 2x6 exterior wall cavities will be filled with OCSF.
    *   **Roof:** The underside of the entire roof deck will be sprayed with OCSF, creating a high-performance, unvented (sealed) attic assembly. The attic space will therefore be a conditioned or semi-conditioned space.
*   **Required R-Values:**
    *   **Walls:** 5.5 inches of OCSF will be applied to achieve an R-value of **R-20**.
    *   **Roof Deck:** 6 inches of OCSF will be applied to the roof deck to achieve an R-value of **R-22**. While code often requires higher R-values for ceilings (R-38), the sealed attic approach provides a superior air barrier, and this R-value on the roof deck is a widely accepted performance path equivalent.
*   **Additional Insulation:**
    *   **Acoustic Control:** Mineral wool batts will be installed in interior walls around all bathrooms and the Master Bedroom suite to reduce sound transmission.
    *   **Air Sealing:** A comprehensive air sealing package is required, using foam and caulk at all building envelope penetrations, in addition to the air sealing properties of the OCSF.
