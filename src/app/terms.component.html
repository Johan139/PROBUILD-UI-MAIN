      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to ProBuild AI, a software-as-a-service platform designed to support licensed professionals in the construction industry. These Terms of Use (‚ÄúTerms‚Äù) govern your access to and use of ProBuild AI‚Äôs platform, website, mobile applications, and related services (collectively, the ‚ÄúPlatform‚Äù), which are operated by ProBuild AI, LLC (‚ÄúProBuild,‚Äù ‚Äúwe,‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù).<br>
      By creating an account or using the Platform, you agree to be legally bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not access or use the Platform.<br>
      These Terms are separate from our Master Services Agreement, which governs subscription and licensing rights. In the event of a conflict, the Master Services Agreement prevails.</p>
