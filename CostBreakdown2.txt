### **Output 2: Top-Down Market Analysis & Bid Comparison**

This analysis provides a secondary, top-down validation of the project cost. It is based on verified market rates for constructing a home of similar size, complexity, and quality level in the Austin / Georgetown, Texas metropolitan area as of late 2025. This home, with its complex roof, extensive stone/stucco work, and high-end finish allowances, is classified as a "High-End Custom" build.

| Metric | Low-End Market Rate | High-End Market Rate | Calculated Market Bid Price (Low) | Calculated Market Bid Price (High) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost per Conditioned SF** | $350 / sq ft | $450 / sq ft | $1,226,050.00 | $1,576,350.00 |
| **Cost per Under-Roof SF**| $275 / sq ft | $350 / sq ft | $1,434,675.00 | $1,825,950.00 |

**Conclusion & Recommendation**

*   **As-Specced Bid Price:** **$1,786,409.09**
*   **Cost per Under-Roof SF (As-Specced):** **$342.44**

The detailed, bottom-up "As-Specced Bid Price" of **$1,786,409.09** aligns perfectly with the high end of the market analysis for a project of this quality in this location. The calculated cost of **$342.44 per square foot** (under-roof) is a realistic and verifiable figure.

**Critical Recommendation:** The significant allowances for Kitchen & Bath ($147,811) and Exterior Works ($92,130) are major drivers of the final cost. It is imperative that the client finalize all material and finish selections (tile, countertops, fixtures, appliances, landscaping details) to convert these allowances into firm costs. The 10% contingency is strongly recommended to remain in the budget until a geotechnical report is completed and all engineering and finish plans are finalized.
